## Notes
- bias of neuron is constrained via a non-linear function like `tanh`
- topo sort to backpropagate gradients through graph
- guard to promote prim number to `Value` as well as using `r` variants of `mul` and `add` to make things easier 
- redefine divison as `self * other**-1`
- redefine subtraction as addition of a negation
- negation is multiplying by -1
