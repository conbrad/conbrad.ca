### Neural Network

- specific class of mathematical expressions
    - take inputs as data, the weights, mathematical expression for the forward pass (neurons doing their local calc followed by their output), followed by a loss function, where loss function tries to measure accuracy of the predictions
    - usually loss will be low when predictions are matching 
    your targets
    - we backward the loss; use backprop to get the gradient, then we know how to tune all the parameters to decrease the loss locally
    - iterate the above many times using gradient descent
    - simply follow the gradient info and that minimized the loss

- structure
    - composes layers of neurons, layers compose neurons, and tie outputs from one layer to the next layer
    - finally maps outputs from 2nd last layer to output layer with single neuron

##### forward pass: neurons compute their local state and output using the activation function
##### backward pass: use gradient descent to nudge values
##### measure loss: check computed loss function to see if loss is minimized

### Neuron

- sum up weights and bias for each neuron
- apply activation function to sum of weights, which clamps extremes
    - this is why `tan h` is used

#### gradient descent
- gradient (that we calculate with `Value` class) is a vector that is pointing in the direction of increased loss
    - the derivative or gradient of this neuron is negative
    - if the data value goes lower, we increase the loss
    - to minimize the loss, we need to "point" in the opposite direction of the gradient vector, so we nudge the data value by a negative of its gradient
    - modifiying `p.data` with a small step size in the direction of the gradient
    - then we iterate this process until loss is minimized (to some definition of minimized)
